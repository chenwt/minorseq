## Quick Tools Overview

### [Minor variant caller](doc/JULIET.md)

`juliet` identifies minor variants from aligned ccs reads.

### [Reduce alignment](doc/FUSE.md)

`fuse` reduces an alignment into its closest representative sequence.

### [Swap BAM reference](doc/CLERIC.md)

`cleric` swaps the reference of an alignment by transitive alignment.

### [Minor variant pipeline](doc/JULIETFLOW.md)

`julietflow` automatizes the minor variant pipeline.

### [Mix Data _In-Silico_](doc/MIXDATA.md)

`mixdata` helps to mix clonal strains _in-silico_ for benchmarking studies.
